                <p>
                    Our users are frustrated that while they are in quarantine they do not get a chance to
                    choose what food they eat. They receive premade boxed meals delivered to their doors
                    for each meal. Our solution should provide these students with the ability to choose and
                    order food through the university meal plan and have it delivered to their door.
